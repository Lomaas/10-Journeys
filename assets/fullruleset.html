	<h2> General information </h2>
		<p> The game is a turn-based game where you can play against your friends. The game challenges your brain and improves your geographic skills.
			The goal of the game is to set up a journey around Europe and Northern Africa. You can use boats, flights and trains to connect your travel route together.
			You start by drawing ten cards from the card deck. These ten cards now make up your travel route. Then turn-by-turn you exchange one card from your route with another until your route is correctly connected. The card you exchange will go into one of three discard piles available for your opponent to draw when it is his/her turn. 
			The game goes on until one player has a correctly connected travel route.

			You can play against your friends or random people.
